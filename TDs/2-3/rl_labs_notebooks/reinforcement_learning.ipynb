    "# Reinforcement learning functions\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast with dynamic programming functions, the reinforcement learning functions are applied when the MDP is unknown.\n",
    "More precisely, the state and action spaces are known, but the agent does not know the transition nor the reward function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we focus on *model free* reinforcement learning, the model-based case is treated [here](mbrl.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## TD learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a state and an action spaces as well as a policy, TD(0) computes the state value of this policy based on the following equation: \n",
    "    $$V^{(t+1)}(x_t) = V^{(t)}(x_t) + \\alpha\\delta_t,$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $\\delta_t = r(x_t,u_t) + \\gamma V^{(t)}(x_{t+1})-V^{(t)}(x_t)$ is the TD error and $\\alpha$ is a parameter called \"learning rate\".</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is provided below, so that you can take inspiration later on. The important part is the computation of $\\delta$, and the update of the values of $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have understood the code, write in the cell just below the code to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: to run TD learning, you need a policy as input. You can retreive such a policy by using the policy iteration method defined in the [dynamic_programming.ipynb](dynamic_programming.ipynb) notebook. Just import it, call it, and use the resulting policy as evaluated policy.\n"
